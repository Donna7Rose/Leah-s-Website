<p><h3>What Population will we Serve?</h3><h5>We are targeting people of all ages because everyone can have problems that matter no matter how small, but we mostly want to serve teenagers.</h5></p>

<p><h3>What is the Problem We are Addressing and Why?</h3>
<h5>Some people don’t always have anybody to talk to, so we wish to give them a chance to talk about their problems.</h5></p>

<p><h3>How will we address the problem with technology?</h3>
<h5>We will be creating an app that we're calling “Let’s Talk” that will employ counselors and therapists that can talk to users of the app via messages or facetime depending on the user’s wants.</h5></p>

<p><h3>How will we test this app and gain attention and funding?</h3>
<h5>We will appeal to schools and parents or a counseling company to help us test our app, and we will use social media to spread the word about “Let’s Talk”. Additionally, we will also be doing local pop ups. To get funding we will pitch the idea to kickstart.</h5></p>

<p><h3>Additional Information</h3>
<h5>“Let’s talk” provides daily inspirational videos, a list of counselors for users to choose from, a function for taking notes while facetiming or chatting anonymously. There is a two week free trial, by the time it is over the customer should have developed a relationship with a counselor to such an extent that they will have the motivation to continue using the app and hopefully will have solved a few of their issues.</h5></p>
